## Free protection from Malware (and Porn) for your home internet

Firstly, we all know most adults won't be choosing Option 2, but you can get FREE Malware protection from Cloudflare with NO additional apps or software...

Malware is a huge problem affecting both businesses and people like you and me everyday. These bad actors use sophisticated methods to trick and confuse us to click on dodgy links in Email/SMS/WhatsApp/etc that result in your device being infected, and you won't even realise until its too late, then they have all of your personal information and files.

Even the best Anti-Virus software/EDR solution can't catch everything, but you can benefit from Cloudflare's Internet intelligence to filter content on your home wifi, which will help protect your critical information with just a few clicks.

Just chose your device type and follow these simple instructions:

*   [iPhone/iPad](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/ios/)
*   [Android](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/android/)
*   [Mac](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/macos/)
*   [Windows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/windows/)
*   [Linux](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/linux/)

Note: use the DNS Servers listed under the following dropdown:

#### Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families

```
1.1.1.2
1.0.0.2
```

If you have young children, you can protect their devices from both Malware & Porn for FREE just as easily, simply follow the same instructions as above but use the DNS Servers listed under the following dropdown:

#### Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families

```
1.1.1.3
1.0.0.3
```

I have updated my daughter's tablet and laptop and it was super easy, let me know if you have any questions or queries... happy to help :)
